# Artificial intelligence
### Simply put
Main focus of this respository is the concept of artifical intelligence to train and test data
both with simple linear regression and multiple linear regression with 3D.
Gives insight on the general idea of the algorithm.
Linear as you know is a striaght line, linear regression sometimes called 'Best fit line' basically means drawing a line between data points.
some basic formula is y=mx+b where Y is our output(labels) variable or dependent variable whereas x is our independent variable.
X(input variable) on the other hand is what we feed our model and is also called the n_features.
we only need to know the value(s) of either x or y to find one of the variables(x=y) or (y=x)

### Some maths
From the formula, y=mx+b
y=1.5x+0.5
let's assume x=2
y=1.5(2)+0.5
y=3.5(we can  also do thisn for y to find x)(change x to subjecy of formula)

In 3 dimension, x,y=z or z,y=x where z is now our output vraiable.
